## WreckSys
WreckSys is a sequential recommendation system for Fantasy & Paranormal novels built in TensorFlow. Originally designed to deliver terrible recommendations on purpose, it now does so mostly by accident.

Recommendations are based on the [Goodreads Dataset](https://mengtingwan.github.io/data/goodreads)

It was originally created as a [WGU](http://www.wgu.edu/) Capstone project before taking on a life of its own.
